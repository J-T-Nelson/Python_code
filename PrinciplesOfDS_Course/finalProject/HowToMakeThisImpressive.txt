Would be good if my project had more impressive results. I think it is achievable with some real gusto and willingness to push hard. 

The obvious means of making it more impressive is simple testing more models, with more preprocessing techniques, and engineering efficient means of doing so with the tools at hand

Beyond that, presenting things with a markup document (or some kind of README type document for the github page) which shows many graphs and findings and explains my process would be the ideal. 

The man obstacle to this right now is that learning new techniques is hard, and having enough grasp over things to create a relatively clever system is hard. Maybe it would be good to find a tutorial vidoe doing some similar classification to piggy back off of for some of my work. Otherwise, simply drilling down consistently and with highly focused work over several sessions in the next 10 days would be key.
