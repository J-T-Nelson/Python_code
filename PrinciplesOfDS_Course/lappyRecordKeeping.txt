# going to record the various modules I will need to install and other actions required for my lappy here to ease the process..

COMMANDS: 
pip install numpy
pip install sys
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip3 install networkx
pip install scikit-learn 
 ----- This is sklearn... there is just some weird interaction where sklearn is a abbreviated... but (previously) grabbable alias of scikit-learn.. for me installing 'sklearn' just doesn't actuallly work... very confusing. So just don't ever install it that way, as there is some weirdness that is easily avoided by just installing it by full name. You can however, still import it by 'sklearn'
pip install -U 'packageName' <- to upgrade packages
pip install -h <- to see help message
